                  structure and similarity among 244 variables. From Parallel Analysis Screen Plot in Table 6.1, optimized factor number is around twenty which is the 
                  intersection between FA Actual Data and FA Resampled Data. After arrived at a probable number of factors, it is time to perform factor analysis at number twenty.

                  (RMSR) is 0.02 which is pretty closer to 0. RMSEA (root mean square error of approximation) index is 0.042. As it is below 0.05, it is a good model fit based

                  One of reasons that U.S citizens answered the questionnaires in certain ways is because of the existence of emancipative values. Emancipative values in one of the major cultural       components of human empowerment in the United States. Emancipative values help increase peopleâ€™s capabilities, aspirations and entitlements to exercise freedom. Generally, there are four categories of defining personal value and belief, including traditional values, secular-rational values, survival values and self-expression values. Firstly, traditional values have preferences on religion, parent-child ties, deference to traditional family values and rejection to suicide, abortion and divorce. US society places emphasis on traditional values which have a high level of national pride. The opposite preferences to traditional values are called secular-rational values. As existential security in US increases, the society cultivates more on traditional value.
                  Additionally, there are two opposite values which belong to level of trust and tolerance. American has strong emphasis on self-expression values. The self-expression value emphasis on high tolerance of gender equality, foreigners, homosexuality, high priority on decision-making participation in political and economic life and environment protection. On the contrary, survival value focus on low acceptance of outsiders with weak sense of happiness. Since US society policy makers always try to build civil society with rising individual agency, the society moves focus from survival value to self-expression value. Also, there are a few limitations with respect to the data analysis of World Value Survey. On the basis of this data analysis report, the analysis does not extend to other waves of survey. Moreover, the EDA and EFA sections do not seek to trace back to the older time for further US survey investigations. Discussion in this report would be more interesting if do further research and data analysis cross the countries.
